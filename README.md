Unsolved Issues:
The main and biggest issue would be the actual bot that is supposed to save the data and then proceed to checkout and purchase the shoe does not work. The logic behind how I need it to work isn't entirely there.

Development Story: Planning, Process, and Problem Solving
What went into planning primarily focused on the goal of the actual app and whether I not I actually wanted the bot to be able to simulate a real experience for the user to have an idea of how it would work on another site. As well as what the bot actually needed to know in order to fill out the required fields.

The process involed focusing on getting the basics down, and formatting the site correctly to have an idea of how I wanted it to flow and appear. The next step was creating a multi step form that would entail save all the information the user put into it to be used at a later time. The next step would be creating a add to cart/ checkout page to simulate the process and then eventually creating the bot itself.
Problem solving, was mainly determining how to properly use React to do a certain task, compared to plain Javascript. Which revolved around a lot of googling, and asking my peers for my help.
